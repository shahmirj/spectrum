Spectrum
========

Color based platform game, which allows you to navigate by changing the world's colors.

### Iulia's weird abstract dream (???!!!)

How does your state of mind change the way you perceive the world around you? In the dichromatic world of Spectrum, you can only interact with objects that match your own colour. Sometimes this helps, sometimes it does not, sometimes you might want to change your colour altogether! Switch from red to blue and back to make your way to the white square.

### Instructions
Use the Arrow keys to move right and left. Your objective is to get the coloured square to touch the white square.

### Installing Linux
Download:

 - OpenGL and GLUT
 - SDL v1.2
 - Box2D v2.2.1 (https://code.google.com/p/box2d/downloads/detail?name=Box2D_v2.1.2.zip&can=2&q=)

Inside the root folder run:

    make clean all && ./color

### Installing Windows
Known to work on windows in its early stages. You will need OpenGL and GLUT, Box2D 2.13 and SDL 1.2 with a bit of luck.
